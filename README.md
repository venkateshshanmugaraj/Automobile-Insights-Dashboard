# Step 1: Project Objective

## The main objective of this project is to analyze automobile sales and performance data to gain insights into:

 * Sales trends

 * Brand and model performance

 * Fuel type and transmission impact

 * Price and mileage comparison


# Step 2: Data Collection

## Collected automobile dataset in Excel/CSV format

 * Data includes:

 * Brand

 * Model

 * Year

 * Fuel type

 * Transmission

 * Price

 * Mileage

 * Engine capacity


# Step 3: Data Import

 * Opened Power BI Desktop

 * Used Get Data → Excel/CSV

 * Loaded the dataset into Power BI

# Step 4: Data Cleaning (Power Query)

## Performed data preprocessing using Power Query Editor:

 * Removed duplicate records

 * Handled missing/null values

 * Changed incorrect data types (price, year, mileage)

 * Renamed columns for better clarity

 * Standardized text values (fuel type, transmission)

# Step 5: Data Modeling

 * Checked relationships between tables (if multiple tables used)

 * Ensured correct data types for calculations

 * Created a clean and optimized data model

# Step 6: DAX Calculations

## Created DAX measures such as:

 * Total Cars Count

 * Average Price

 * Average Mileage

 * Max and Min Price

 * Year-wise sales count

 * These measures help in dynamic analysis and filtering.

# Step 7: Dashboard Design

## Designed an interactive dashboard using:

 * Cards → Key metrics (Total cars, Avg price, Avg mileage)

 * Bar charts → Brand-wise and model-wise analysis

 * Line charts → Year-wise trends

 * Pie/Donut charts → Fuel type & transmission distribution

 * Slicers → Brand, fuel type, year, transmission

# Step 8: Interactivity & Filters

 * Added slicers for easy filtering

 * Enabled cross-filtering between visuals

 * Applied drill-down for detailed analysis

# Step 9: Insights & Analysis

## Key insights derived:

 * Identified top automobile brands by count and price

 * Compared fuel types based on mileage and cost

 * Analyzed how transmission affects pricing

 * Observed year-wise automobile trends

# Step 10: Final Review & Optimization

 * Checked dashboard performance

 * Improved layout and color consistency

 * Added proper titles and labels

 * Ensured user-friendly navigation

# Step 11: Deployment & Sharing

## Saved the project as .pbix

## Uploaded to GitHub with:

 * Project description

 * Dataset

 * Dashboard screenshots

 * Can be published to Power BI Service for online sharing
